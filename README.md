# 📚 EduTutor AI: Personalized Learning with Generative AI and LMS Integration

EduTutor AI is an AI-powered education platform that personalizes the learning experience for students while giving educators real-time insights into student progress. This project demonstrates dynamic quiz generation, student diagnostics, Google Classroom integration (mocked), and adaptive learning — all simulated using Python.
